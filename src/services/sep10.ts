/**
 * SEP-10 (Stellar Web Authentication) — challenge creation and verification.
 *
 * The server holds one signing keypair (SEP10_SIGNING_SECRET). It builds a
 * challenge transaction the client's wallet signs; verifying that signature is
 * what proves control of the account, and it is the only thing standing in
 * front of every protected group and settlement action. So verification is
 * deliberately strict and layered:
 *
 *  1. `readChallenge` decodes the envelope, requires **our** server signature
 *     over **our** network passphrase, checks the time bounds and home domain,
 *     then hands it to `WebAuth.readChallengeTx` against our network, server
 *     account, home domain, and web auth domain. A challenge built for another
 *     network, another anchor, or another domain fails here — the signature is
 *     computed over network-dependent bytes, so it cannot survive a passphrase
 *     swap.
 *  2. `validateChallengeEnvelope` re-checks the structure this server actually
 *     issues: server-sourced, sequence 0, no memo, real time bounds (checked
 *     explicitly against server time with clock-skew tolerance — expired,
 *     not-yet-valid, and over-long windows each get their own code), one
 *     client-sourced `<home domain> auth` operation carrying a large enough
 *     nonce for a G... account, and exactly one server-sourced
 *     `web_auth_domain` entry — nothing else (`client_domain` is not
 *     supported). An unrelated transaction envelope has no way through this.
 *  3. Signatures are verified against the client account: the master key for an
 *     unfunded account, the account's signers and medium threshold otherwise.
 *     The server's own signature is required by both SDK checks.
 *  4. Only then is the challenge **consumed**, exactly once. Consumption is a
 *     conditional insert, so concurrent verifications of the same envelope
 *     resolve to one winner and the rest are rejected as replays. The record
 *     is kept until the envelope's own `maxTime` plus the clock-skew
 *     tolerance, so it cannot be swept while the challenge is still usable.
 *
 * A rejected credential is always a 401 with a stable code. Anything this
 * server did not demonstrably sign — undecodable, tampered with, built by
 * someone else — is the opaque INVALID_CHALLENGE, so a forger learns nothing
 * about which check failed. Only an envelope carrying this server's signature
 * earns a precise answer: NETWORK_MISMATCH (signed for another network),
 * CHALLENGE_EXPIRED / CHALLENGE_NOT_YET_VALID / CHALLENGE_WINDOW_TOO_LONG (its
 * window), HOME_DOMAIN_MISMATCH (another home domain), or INVALID_SIGNATURE
 * (client signatures that do not verify — the remedy is re-signing, not a new
 * challenge). Structural failures, replays, and anything else stay
 * INVALID_CHALLENGE. 401 rather than 400 is SEP-10-compliant: the spec's token
 * endpoint treats every non-200 status as an error (SEP-10 v3.4.1, "Token" →
 * "Response").
 *
 * The exceptions are this server's own dependencies, which fail closed but are
 * not reported as bad credentials: an unreachable challenge store is a 503
 * SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (see `challengeStoreUnavailable`) and an unreachable
 * Horizon a 502 UPSTREAM_ERROR (see `signerLookupUnavailable`), because an
 * outage that reports itself as a wave of bad credentials is unactionable for
 * the operator and unrecoverable for the client. The SDK's message, the
 * challenge XDR, and any signature material are never echoed back or logged
 * either way.
 *
 * Successful verification returns the client's public key; minting the session
 * token stays in src/routes/auth.ts, whose claims contract is unchanged.
