/**
 * Group expense calculation service — pure functions, no I/O.
 *
 * A group can record expenses in more than one Stellar asset (XLM and USDC are
 * both 7-decimal assets, but a stroop of one is worth nothing in the other).
 * This module owns the arithmetic that turns a set of expenses into:
 *
 *   1. exact per-participant shares for a new expense (`splitExpense`), and
 *   2. a per-asset, per-participant breakdown of what each member paid and owes
 *      (`calculateGroupExpenseBreakdown`), optionally normalized into a single
 *      target asset so the numbers can be compared before settlement
 *      transaction construction.
 *
 * Every amount is handled as a BigInt number of stroops (10^7 per unit), never
 * as a JavaScript number. Currency conversion uses an integer rate scaled to
 * the same 7 decimals, so a rate of `0.1` is exactly ten millionths and no
 * binary floating-point drift can enter the ledger.
 *
 * Rounding contract:
 *   - Splits never create or destroy value: the shares always sum *exactly* to
 *     the expense total. Each participant gets the floor of their weighted
 *     allocation, and the tail stroops (fewer than the participant count) are
 *     distributed one each by largest fractional remainder.
 *   - A converted breakdown preserves each asset's total exactly. The asset
 *     total is floored once, then allocated across participants by largest
 *     fractional remainder, so `sum(participant amounts) == converted total`.
 *
 * The functions are deliberately free of Prisma calls and route concerns; they
 * accept plain records shaped like the persisted `Expense`/`ExpenseShare` rows
 * (including `Prisma.Decimal`-like values) so callers can pass query results
 * straight through after adding the shares relation.

/**
 * Compute a group's expense breakdown, per asset and optionally normalized.
 *
 * For each asset the result records, per participant:
 *   - `paid` — the sum of expenses that participant fronted,
 *   - `owed` — the sum of that participant's shares, and
 *   - `net` — `paid - owed` (positive: the group owes them).
 *
 * Within every asset, `sum(paid) === sum(owed) === total` and the nets sum to
 * zero exactly, because each expense is validated to have shares summing to its
 * amount. This is the gross picture used to construct settlement intents; it
 * does not subtract already-confirmed settlements (see
 * `computeNetBalancesByAsset` in `services/settlement` for outstanding
 * balances).
 *
 * When `targetAsset` is supplied, each asset's per-participant paid/owed
 * allocations are converted with the integer rate for that asset (see
 * `ConversionRateInput`), preserving each asset total exactly. Participants are
 * then aggregated across assets into one net figure, so XLM and USDC amounts
 * can be compared and offset in a single settlement currency without ever
 * letting a floating-point conversion leak into the ledger.
 *
 * @throws {ExpenseCalculationError} `UNSUPPORTED_ASSET`, `INVALID_AMOUNT`,
 *   `INVALID_PARTICIPANTS`, `DUPLICATE_PARTICIPANT`, `INCONSISTENT_EXPENSE`,
 *   `INVALID_RATE`, `MISSING_RATE`, or `AMOUNT_OVERFLOW`.
