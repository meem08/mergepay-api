/**
 * Standardized application error handling.
 *
 * Every intentional error thrown by a route handler or service should be an
 * instance of `AppError`. The central error handler in `app.ts` reads these
 * fields to build the standard JSON response:
 *
 *   {
 *     code: string,           // machine-readable code (e.g. "NOT_FOUND")
 *     message: string,        // human-readable description
 *     requestId: string,      // Fastify request.id for correlation / tracing
 *     details?: unknown[],    // optional structured detail (e.g. Zod issues)
 *   }
 *
 * The HTTP status code is conveyed via the response status — it is not
 * duplicated in the body. Stack traces, SQL, credentials, signed XDRs, and
 * upstream response bodies are never included in the response.
